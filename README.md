# taskscheduling
Test the taskscheduling using genetic algorithm, with a purpose of reducing completion time of tasks.

Before submitting cloudlets, Broker can assign cloudlets to virtual machines, which is a NP-hard problem.
Hence, Genetic algorithm can be used to create a binding relationship which can reduce time to complete tasks.
